# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
This project currently contains only an `index.html` file and an empty `images/` directory. There are no other source files, documentation, or configuration files present.

## Key Conventions
- The main entry point is `index.html` at the project root.
- The `images/` directory is intended for static assets, but is currently empty.
- No build, test, or automation scripts are present.
- No external dependencies or frameworks are detected.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- If implementing features, start by editing or populating `index.html`.
- For static assets (e.g., images), place them in the `images/` directory.
- If you introduce new conventions, document them here for future agents.
- If you add build tools, frameworks, or additional structure, update this file to reflect those changes.

## Example Patterns
- To add an image: place it in `images/` and reference it in `index.html` using a relative path, e.g. `<img src="images/example.png">`.
- To expand the project, consider adding CSS or JS files in new directories (e.g., `css/`, `js/`) and update this file accordingly.

## Missing Information
- No README or prior agent instructions were found. If you add significant structure or logic, create a `README.md` and update this file.
